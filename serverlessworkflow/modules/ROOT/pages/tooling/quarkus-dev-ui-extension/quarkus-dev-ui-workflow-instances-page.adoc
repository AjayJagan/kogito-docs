= Kogito Serverless Workflow Instances page

The Workflow Instances page is a user interface for monitoring and managing the available Workflow Instances. It has filtering capabilities which allows you to <<Workflow Instance filters,filter>> the necessary details and provides a <<Workflow Instance table,table>> to view the list of available Workflow Instances.

Initially since no Workflow Instances are available, the table does not show any instances.
