= Serverless Workflow Editor

The Serverless Workflow Editor is a tool to manipulate the content of serverless workflow files and simultaneously view the workflow diagram.
The editor has two parts, a code editor with the source code on the left and a workflow diagram visualizer on the right.
As you make changes to the content of the editor, the diagram gets updated with the new change.

== Main features:
* *Dynamic reload of diagram*: The editor has live-reload capability. As we make a change in the source code, the workflow diagram updates automatically.
* *SVG generation*: The editor has the capability to save the workflow diagram as SVG in the workspace.
* *Context based auto-completion*: The editor has intelligent auto completion capabilities which provide suggestions on diffrent contexts.
* *Validation*: The editor performs validation in the Serverless Workflow files, to provide an error free experience to the users.

NOTE: The editor currently performs validation using JSON schema to the structure of workflow file and not the values in it and context based auto-complete works only with JSON and not with YAML.

.The editor is available in the following platforms:
